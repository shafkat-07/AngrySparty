# AngrySparty

### An angry birds game but without the birds! Made with C++ using CMake. Various methods such as encapsulation, inheritence, and common C++ patterns were used for this project (such as the visitor pattern). Only 4 levels are available for demo purposes, with the last level being particularly challenging!
